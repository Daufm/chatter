# Implementation Plan: Chat App

**Branch**: `main` | **Date**: 2025-10-27 | **Spec**: /specs/main/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/main/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement a real-time chat application with sidebar for contacts/groups, main chat window with timestamps, message input with emoji and file upload, and responsive layout for mobile/desktop. Technical approach: Frontend with Vite + React + TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI; Backend with Node.js + Express + Socket.io + MongoDB (Mongoose) + local file storage; Real-time via WebSocket.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (ES6+), Node.js 18+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Vite, React, TailwindCSS, ShadCN UI, Express, Socket.io, Mongoose  
**Storage**: MongoDB for messages/users/groups, local filesystem for file uploads (upgrade to S3 later)  
**Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library for frontend, NEEDS CLARIFICATION for backend (e.g., Jest or Mocha)  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), responsive for mobile/desktop  
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)  
**Performance Goals**: Message appearance within 500 ms (p95)  
**Constraints**: Real-time messaging via WebSocket, responsive UI, accessibility compliant  
**Scale/Scope**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION (e.g., 100 concurrent users, 1000 messages/day initially)

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

The plan MUST explicitly demonstrate alignment with the project constitution. At minimum, the plan MUST confirm:

- Code Quality & Tooling: frontend stack uses React; CI will run ESLint and Prettier. (Include CI job names or commands.)
- Testing Discipline: A test strategy is included showing unit and integration tests for critical flows and which stories will be covered in Phase 1/2.
- UX Standards: Any UI work references the project's UX guidance (rounded corners, subtle shadows, accessibility checklist).
- Performance & Observability: For messaging features, include performance targets (500 ms p95 message appearance), proposed metrics to collect, and a short plan for instrumentation.

The `/speckit.plan` command MUST surface any Constitution Check failures as explicit blockers in the generated plan.

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
