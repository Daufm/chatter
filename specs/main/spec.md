# Feature Specification: Chat App

**Feature Branch**: `main`  
**Created**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "plan: frontend: framework: Vite + React (JavaScript) design: TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI features: - Sidebar with contacts and groups - Main chat window with timestamps - Message input bar with emoji & file upload - Responsive layout for mobile/desktop backend: runtime: Node.js + Express + Socket.io database: mongodb by using(mongoos) file_storage: local (for now, upgrade to S3 later) real_time: protocol: WebSocket (via Socket.io)"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - View Contacts and Groups in Sidebar (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to see a sidebar with my contacts and groups so that I can select who to chat with.

**Why this priority**: This is the entry point for navigation and selecting chat targets, essential for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by rendering the sidebar component with mock data and verifying contacts/groups are displayed and clickable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is logged in, **When** the app loads, **Then** the sidebar shows a list of contacts and groups.
2. **Given** the sidebar is visible, **When** the user clicks on a contact, **Then** the main chat window switches to that contact's conversation.
3. **Given** the sidebar is visible, **When** the user clicks on a group, **Then** the main chat window switches to that group's conversation.

### User Story 2 - View Chat Messages with Timestamps (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to see messages in the main chat window with timestamps so that I can follow the conversation timeline.

**Why this priority**: Displaying messages is the core of the chat app, allowing users to read conversations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by rendering the chat window component with mock messages and verifying messages and timestamps are displayed correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a conversation is selected, **When** the chat window loads, **Then** messages are displayed in chronological order with timestamps.
2. **Given** new messages arrive, **When** they are received, **Then** they appear in the chat window with current timestamps.
3. **Given** the chat window is scrolled, **When** more messages are loaded, **Then** older messages with timestamps are shown.

### User Story 3 - Send Messages with Emoji and File Upload (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to send messages including emojis and files so that I can express myself fully in conversations.

**Why this priority**: Sending messages is key to interaction, with emoji and files adding richness.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by interacting with the input bar component, sending messages, and verifying they appear in the chat window.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the input bar is focused, **When** the user types a message and presses enter, **Then** the message is sent and appears in the chat window.
2. **Given** the input bar is focused, **When** the user selects an emoji, **Then** the emoji is added to the message and can be sent.
3. **Given** the input bar is focused, **When** the user uploads a file, **Then** the file is attached to the message and sent.
4. **Given** a file is uploaded, **When** the message is sent, **Then** the file is stored and a link or preview is shown in the chat.

### User Story 4 - Responsive Layout for Mobile and Desktop (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want the app to work well on both mobile and desktop so that I can use it on any device.

**Why this priority**: Responsiveness ensures accessibility across devices, improving user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by resizing the browser window or using device emulators and verifying layout adapts correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the app is viewed on desktop, **When** the window is wide, **Then** sidebar and chat window are side by side.
2. **Given** the app is viewed on mobile, **When** the window is narrow, **Then** sidebar is collapsible or hidden, chat window takes full width.
3. **Given** the app is viewed on mobile, **When** the user taps the sidebar toggle, **Then** sidebar slides in/out.

## Constitution Alignment _(mandatory)_

- Code Quality & Tooling: Frontend uses React as required; CI will run ESLint and Prettier; tests will use Jest + React Testing Library.
- Testing Discipline: Unit tests for components (sidebar, chat window, input bar); integration tests for user flows (sending messages, switching conversations); acceptance criteria defined above.
- UX Standards: Design uses TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI for clean, modern look with rounded corners and subtle shadows; responsive breakpoints for mobile/desktop; accessibility checks for keyboard navigation and screen readers.
- Performance & Observability: Message appearance SLO of 500 ms p95 applies; latency metrics for WebSocket connections; structured logs for message delivery.

This section is mandatory and will be verified by the `/speckit.plan` and `/speckit.tasks` workflows.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the WebSocket connection drops? (Messages should queue and retry.)
- How does the system handle large groups with many messages? (Pagination or virtual scrolling.)
- What if a file upload fails? (Show error message and allow retry.)
- How to handle offline state? (Indicate connection status, disable sending when offline.)
- What about message delivery confirmation? (Show sent/read status.)

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a sidebar with user contacts and groups.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow selecting a contact or group to view the chat.
- **FR-003**: System MUST display messages in the main chat window with timestamps.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow sending text messages via the input bar.
- **FR-005**: System MUST support adding emojis to messages.
- **FR-006**: System MUST support uploading and sending files.
- **FR-007**: System MUST store messages in a database (MongoDB via Mongoose).
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle real-time message delivery via WebSocket (Socket.io).
- **FR-009**: System MUST store uploaded files locally (upgrade to S3 later).
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide responsive layout for mobile and desktop viewports.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **User**: Represents a chat user; key attributes: id, username, email, avatar (optional).
- **Group**: Represents a chat group; key attributes: id, name, members (array of User ids), createdAt.
- **Message**: Represents a chat message; key attributes: id, sender (User id), recipient (User or Group id), content (text), timestamp, attachments (array of file urls), type (text/file).
- **File**: Represents an uploaded file; key attributes: id, filename, url, uploadedBy (User id), uploadedAt.

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can send and receive messages within 500 ms (p95 latency).
- **SC-002**: App loads and displays sidebar/chat on mobile/desktop without layout issues (100% responsive test pass).
- **SC-003**: File uploads complete successfully 99% of the time under normal conditions.
- **SC-004**: 95% of users can complete a full conversation flow (select contact, send message, receive response) without errors.</content>
