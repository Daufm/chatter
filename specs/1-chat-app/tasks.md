# Tasks: Web-based Chat Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/1-chat-app/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are mandatory per constitution. Include unit and integration tests for each user story.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- Adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan (backend/, frontend/, etc.)
- [x] T002 Initialize backend project with Node.js + Express + Socket.io + Mongoose (backend/package.json, server.js)
- [ ] T003 [P] Frontend setup: Initialize React + Vite + TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI (frontend/package.json, vite.config.js)
- [ ] T004 [P] Configure linting and formatting: ESLint + Prettier for both frontend and backend
- [x] T005 [P] Configure test runners: Jest + React Testing Library for frontend, Jest + Supertest for backend
- [ ] T006 [P] Add CI pipeline skeleton that runs lint, format, and test jobs on PRs (.github/workflows/ci.yml)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-10)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - P1 stories (US1-US3) can proceed in parallel
  - P2 stories (US4-US6) depend on P1 completion
  - P3 stories (US7-US8) depend on P2 completion
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: No dependencies
- **US2 (P1)**: No dependencies
- **US3 (P1)**: No dependencies
- **US4 (P2)**: Depends on US3 (sending messages)
- **US5 (P2)**: Depends on US2 (message display)
- **US6 (P2)**: Depends on US3 (message sending)
- **US7 (P3)**: Depends on US2 (message display)
- **US8 (P3)**: Depends on US1, US2 (layout components)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- P1 stories can run in parallel
- Within each story, tests and models can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (P1 Stories Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational
3. Complete Phases 3-5: P1 stories
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test P1 independently
5. Deploy/demo MVP

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add P1 stories ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy
3. Add P2 stories ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy
4. Add P3 stories ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. P1: Developer A: US1, B: US2, C: US3
3. P2: Developer A: US4, B: US5, C: US6
4. P3: Developer A: US7, B: US8

- Each task includes goal, effort (S/M/L), dependencies
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story
- Tests mandatory per constitution
