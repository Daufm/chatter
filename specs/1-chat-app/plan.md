# Implementation Plan: Web-based Chat Application

**Branch**: `1-chat-app` | **Date**: 2025-10-27 | **Spec**: /specs/1-chat-app/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/1-chat-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement a web-based chat application supporting one-to-one and group messaging with sidebar for contacts/groups, main chat window with timestamps, reactions, @mentions, pinned messages, text/image/file messaging, real-time updates via Socket.io, responsive layout, and polished visual design. Technical approach: Frontend with React + Vite + TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI; Backend with Node.js + Express + Socket.io; Database MongoDB via Mongoose; File storage local (later S3); Authentication JWT-based; Real-time notifications via Socket.io events; Deployment Vercel (frontend) + Render (backend).

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript, Node.js 18+  
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Vite, TailwindCSS, ShadCN UI, Express, Socket.io, Mongoose, jsonwebtoken  
**Storage**: MongoDB for messages/users/groups, local filesystem for file uploads (migrate to S3 later)  
**Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library for frontend, Jest + Supertest for backend API and Socket.io  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), responsive for mobile/desktop  
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)  
**Performance Goals**: Message appearance within 500 ms (p95)  
**Constraints**: Real-time messaging via Socket.io, JWT authentication, responsive UI, polished design  
**Scale/Scope**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION (e.g., initial target 100 concurrent users, 1000 messages/day)

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

The plan MUST explicitly demonstrate alignment with the project constitution. At minimum, the plan MUST confirm:

- Code Quality & Tooling: frontend stack uses React; CI will run ESLint and Prettier. (Include CI job names or commands.)
- Testing Discipline: A test strategy is included showing unit and integration tests for critical flows and which stories will be covered in Phase 1/2.
- UX Standards: Any UI work references the project's UX guidance (rounded corners, subtle shadows, accessibility checklist).
- Performance & Observability: For messaging features, include performance targets (500 ms p95 message appearance), proposed metrics to collect, and a short plan for instrumentation.

The `/speckit.plan` command MUST surface any Constitution Check failures as explicit blockers in the generated plan.

**Structure Decision**: Web application with separate frontend and backend directories. Frontend uses Vite for build, backend uses Express. Tests separated by type. This structure supports independent deployment to Vercel and Render.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
