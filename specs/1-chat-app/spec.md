Include: - Sidebar with user contacts and group list - Main chat window with timestamps - Reactions, @mentions, pinned messages - Text, image, and file messaging - Real-time updates with Socket.io - Responsive layout and polished visual design - Expected outcomes and user success criteria"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - View Contacts and Groups in Sidebar (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to see a sidebar with my contacts and groups so that I can select who to chat with.

**Why this priority**: This is the navigation entry point for messaging, essential for basic functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is logged in, **When** the app loads, **Then** the sidebar shows a list of contacts and groups.
2. **Given** the sidebar is visible, **When** the user clicks on a contact, **Then** the main chat window switches to that contact's conversation.
3. **Given** the sidebar is visible, **When** the user clicks on a group, **Then** the main chat window switches to that group's conversation.

As a user, I want to send text messages so that I can communicate with others.

**Why this priority**: Sending messages is fundamental to chat functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by typing in the input bar and verifying the message appears in the chat window.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the input bar is focused, **When** the user types a message and presses enter, **Then** the message is sent and appears in the chat window.
2. **Given** the message is sent, **When** the recipient views the chat, **Then** they see the message with timestamp.

### User Story 4 - Send Image and File Messages (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to send images and files so that I can share media and documents.

**Why this priority**: Enhances communication with multimedia content.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading an image/file and verifying it appears as a message.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the input bar is focused, **When** the user uploads an image, **Then** the image is sent and displayed in the chat window.
2. **Given** the input bar is focused, **When** the user uploads a file, **Then** the file is sent with a download link in the chat window.
3. **Given** a file is uploaded, **When** the recipient clicks the link, **Then** they can download the file.

### User Story 5 - Add Reactions to Messages (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to add reactions to messages so that I can express agreement or emotion.

**Why this priority**: Reactions add interactivity and engagement to conversations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking a reaction button on a message and verifying the reaction appears.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a message is displayed, **When** the user clicks a reaction emoji, **Then** the reaction is added to the message.
2. **Given** a reaction is added, **When** others view the message, **Then** they see the reaction count.

---

### User Story 6 - Use @Mentions (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to @mention others in messages so that I can notify specific people.

**Why this priority**: Mentions improve targeted communication in groups.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by typing @username and verifying the mention is highlighted.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** typing in the input bar, **When** the user types @ followed by a username, **Then** the username is suggested and can be selected.
2. **Given** a message with @mention is sent, **When** the mentioned user views the chat, **Then** the mention is highlighted.

### User Story 7 - Pin Messages (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to pin important messages so that they stay visible.

**Why this priority**: Pinning helps highlight key information in conversations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by pinning a message and verifying it appears in a pinned section.

### User Story 8 - Responsive Layout (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want the app to work on mobile and desktop so that I can use it anywhere.

**Why this priority**: Ensures accessibility across devices.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by resizing the browser and verifying layout adapts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the app is viewed on desktop, **When** the window is wide, **Then** sidebar and chat are side by side.
2. **Given** the app is viewed on mobile, **When** the window is narrow, **Then** sidebar is collapsible, chat takes full width.

## Constitution Alignment _(mandatory)_

- Code Quality & Tooling: Frontend uses React; CI will run ESLint and Prettier; tests will use Jest + React Testing Library.
- Testing Discipline: Unit tests for components, integration tests for user flows; critical paths like sending messages will have coverage.
- UX Standards: Design uses clean, modern, rounded corners, subtle shadows; responsive for mobile/desktop; accessibility for keyboard/screen readers.
- Performance & Observability: Message appearance within 500 ms p95; structured logs for real-time events; latency metrics for Socket.io.

This section is mandatory and will be verified by the `/speckit.plan` and `/speckit.tasks` workflows.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if Socket.io connection drops? (Messages queue and retry on reconnect.)
- How to handle large files? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum file size for uploads?]
- What file types are supported? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: supported file types and security checks?]
- How to manage large groups? (Assume reasonable limits, e.g., 100 members.)
- What if a message fails to send? (Show error and allow retry.)
