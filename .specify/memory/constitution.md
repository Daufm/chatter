# Chat App Constitution

## Core Principles

### Code Quality & Tooling

All frontend work MUST use React. All code (frontend and supporting services) MUST pass automated quality gates before merge: ESLint for linting, Prettier for formatting, and project-standard type checks where applicable. Pull requests MUST include a passing CI job that runs linting and formatting checks. Code reviews MUST verify that changes are limited in scope, have focused tests, and include documentation for non-obvious decisions.

Rationale: Enforcing consistent tooling reduces review friction, prevents trivial style drift, and makes changes easier to reason about in a cross-functional team.

### User Experience (UX) Standards

User-facing interfaces MUST follow the project's UX guidelines: clean, modern visual language; rounded corners for container elements; subtle elevation (shadows) to express hierarchy; responsive layouts for supported viewports. Accessibility concerns (keyboard navigation, screen reader labels, color contrast) MUST be addressed before user-facing features are accepted.

Rationale: A consistent, accessible UI improves adoption, reduces user friction, and reduces rework from UX regressions.

### Testing Discipline (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The project REQUIRES automated tests. Unit tests and integration tests are mandatory for all feature work. Tests MUST be written for new behavior before or alongside implementation (TDD encouraged). Critical user flows and failure modes MUST have integration test coverage and be included in CI gates. Test failures MUST block merges.

Rationale: Tests preserve correctness, enable safe refactors, and ensure regressions are caught early in CI.

### Performance & Observability

Message delivery and UI updates visible to end users MUST meet the performance SLO: messages should appear within 500 ms (p95) under normal operating conditions. The project MUST include basic observability: structured logs, error reporting, and latency metrics that feed into dashboards and alerting. Performance regressions MUST be identified in PRs that materially affect the messaging path.

Rationale: Chat UX is latency sensitive; hard SLOs and observability ensure we detect and fix regressions before release.

### Simplicity & Incremental Delivery

Prefer the simplest implementation that satisfies requirements. Features MUST be delivered incrementally in independently testable slices. Avoid speculative generalization; YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) applies. When complexity is introduced, it MUST be justified in the PR and documented.

Rationale: Smaller increments lower risk, are easier to review, and shorten feedback loops.

## Technology Constraints

Frontend: React is the required framework for user-facing code. The recommended testing stack is Jest + React Testing Library for unit and integration tests. CI pipelines MUST run linting (ESLint), formatting (Prettier), and the test suite on pull requests. Performance budgets (500 ms p95 for message appearance) and observability hooks (structured logs and latency metrics) MUST be included in new features touching the messaging path.

## Development Workflow & Quality Gates

1. Branching: Feature branches named `feature/xxx` or `fix/xxx`. PRs target the main integration branch.
2. Reviews: All PRs MUST have at least one approving review from a maintainer or peer with relevant domain knowledge.
3. Required CI checks: lint, format, unit tests, integration tests (if affected) and performance smoke checks for messaging paths.
4. Performance & accessibility checks: UI changes MUST include a short accessibility and performance note in the PR description; any regressions from baseline metrics or accessibility scans MUST be addressed before merge.
5. Release: Releases MUST be accompanied by a changelog entry referencing Constitution-aligned impact (e.g., performance, UX, API changes).

## Governance

Amendments to this constitution follow this process:

1. Proposal: Any contributor may draft an amendment and open a PR against `.specify/memory/constitution.md` describing the change, rationale, and migration plan.
2. Review: The proposal MUST be reviewed by at least two maintainers. Major governance changes (removing or redefining principles) MUST be discussed in an issue and require consensus from project maintainers.
3. Ratification: Once approved in PR, record the ratification date and increment the constitution version according to semantic rules (see below). Documentation and dependent templates MUST be updated as part of the PR.

Versioning policy:

- MAJOR: Backwards-incompatible governance or principle removals/renames.
- MINOR: Addition of a new principle or material expansion of guidance.
- PATCH: Clarifications, wording fixes, and non-functional edits.

Compliance reviews: Regular reviews (quarterly recommended) SHOULD be scheduled to verify major sections still apply. PRs that touch core paths (messaging code, UI delivery, performance instrumentation) MUST include a short compliance checklist referencing relevant principles.
